# A retrospective after two years as Elixir Developer
## Init
This year (2023) marks my two-year anniversary as an elixir developer. I started from scratch and decided to create a series of posts trying to describe the problems I encountered at the beginning of my journey. I treat this series as a retrospective on what was a problem for me at the beginning and how, after time, I can clarify and bring them closer.  

## Plan
Below the article and their status:
- Don't be afraid to 'Enum reduce' - work in progress
- A few words about LiveView - not started
- Server side and client side - not started
- Migrations & Relationships - basics - not started
- A digression about beginnings, approach, motivation - not started

## Conclusion
I particularly recommend this series to beginner developers who are in the process of finding answers to the above-mentioned topics.
Enjoy reading :)
